# Sonar Data Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at determining whether a given sonar signal represents a rock or a mine. The project utilizes a dataset available on Kaggle, specifically the [Sonar Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurdalvi/sonar-mine-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)).

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
* src/: Python source code for the machine learning model.
+ Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb: Python script containing the machine learning model.
& requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.
+ README.md: Project documentation.
## Dependencies
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
The main libraries used in this project are:

NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suraj-0210/sonar-classification-project.git
```
2. Explore and modify the code as needed for your use case.
