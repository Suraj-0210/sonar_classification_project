# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project! This repository contains the source code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at determining whether a person has diabetes or not based on several parameters. The project utilizes a dataset that includes information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features. [Diabetes Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6LaTI_V8Etu-RRJ4pcK8Y91aaDCxc5M/view?usp=sharing).

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
* src/: Python source code for the machine learning model.
+ Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb: Python script containing the machine learning model.
& requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.
+ README.md: Project documentation.
## Dependencies
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
The main libraries used in this project are:

NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
## Usage
